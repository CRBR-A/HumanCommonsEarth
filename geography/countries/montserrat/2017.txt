| Area: | total: 102 sq km |
| Area: | land: 102 sq km |
| Area: | water: 0 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | about 0.6 times the size of Washington, DC |
| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | 40 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm |
| Climate: | tropical; little daily or seasonal temperature variation |
| Terrain: | volcanic island, mostly mountainous, with small coastal lowland |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: NA |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Soufriere Hills volcano pre-eruption height was 915 m; current lava dome is subject to periodic build up and collapse; estimated dome height was 1050 m in 2015 |
| Natural resources: | NEGL |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 30% |
| Land use: | arable land 20%; permanent crops 0%; permanent pasture 10% |
| Land use: | forest: 25% |
| Land use: | other: 45% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 0 sq km (2012) |
| Population - distribution: | only the northern half of the island is populated, the southern portion is uninhabitable due to volcanic activity |
| Natural hazards: | volcanic eruptions; severe hurricanes (June to November) |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: Soufriere Hills volcano (915 m), has erupted continuously since 1995; a massive eruption in 1997 destroyed most of the capital, Plymouth, and resulted in approximately half of the island becoming uninhabitable; the island of Montserrat is part of the volcanic island arc of the Lesser Antilles that extends from Saba in the north to Grenada in the south |
| Environment - current issues: | land erosion occurs on slopes that have been cleared for cultivation |
| Geography - note: | the island is entirely volcanic in origin and comprised of three major volcanic centers of differing ages |
