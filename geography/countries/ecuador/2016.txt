| Area: | land: 276,841 sq km |
| Area: | water: 6,720 sq km |
| Area: | note: includes Galapagos Islands |
| Area - comparative: | slightly smaller than Nevada |
| Land boundaries: | total: 2,237 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries (2): Colombia 708 km, Peru 1,529 km |
| Coastline: | 2,237 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 100 nm from 2,500-m isobath |
| Climate: | tropical along coast, becoming cooler inland at higher elevations; tropical in Amazonian jungle lowlands |
| Terrain: | coastal plain (costa), inter-Andean central highlands (sierra), and flat to rolling eastern jungle (oriente) |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 1,117 m |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Chimborazo 6,267 m |
| Elevation: | note: because the earth is not a perfect sphere and has an equatorial bulge, the highest point on the planet farthest from its center is Mount Chimborazo not Mount Everest, which is merely the highest peak above sea level |
| Natural resources: | petroleum, fish, timber, hydropower |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 29.7% |
| Land use: | arable land 4.7%; permanent crops 5.6%; permanent pasture 19.4% |
| Land use: | forest: 38.9% |
| Land use: | other: 31.4% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 15,000 sq km (2012) |
| Population - distribution: | nearly half of the population is concentrated in the interior in the Andean intermontane basins and valleys, with large concentrations also found along the western coastal strip; the rainforests of the east remain sparsely populated |
| Natural hazards: | frequent earthquakes; landslides; volcanic activity; floods; periodic droughts |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: volcanic activity concentrated along the Andes Mountains; Sangay (elev. 5,230 m), which erupted in 2010, is mainland Ecuador's most active volcano; other historically active volcanoes in the Andes include Antisana, Cayambe, Chacana, Cotopaxi, Guagua Pichincha, Reventador, Sumaco, and Tungurahua; Fernandina (elev. 1,476 m), a shield volcano that last erupted in 2009, is the most active of the many Galapagos volcanoes; other historically active Galapagos volcanoes include Wolf, Sierra Negra, Cerro Azul, Pinta, Marchena, and Santiago |
| Environment - current issues: | deforestation; soil erosion; desertification; water pollution; pollution from oil production wastes in ecologically sensitive areas of the Amazon Basin and Galapagos Islands |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | Cotopaxi in Andes is highest active volcano in world |
