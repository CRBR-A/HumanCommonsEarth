| Location: | body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia, and Australia |
| Geographic coordinates: | 20 00 S, 80 00 E |
| Map references: | Political Map of the World |
| Area: | total: 68.556 million sq km |
| Area: | note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Flores Sea, Great Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Java Sea, Mozambique Channel, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Savu Sea, Strait of Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies |
| Area - comparative: | about 5.5 times the size of the US |
| Coastline: | 66,526 km |
| Climate: | northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February in the southern Indian Ocean |
| Terrain: | surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and currents, while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Java Trench -7,258 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: sea level 0 m |
| Natural resources: | oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules |
| Natural hazards: | occasional icebergs pose navigational hazard in southern reaches |
| Environment - current issues: | endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea |
| Geography - note: | major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait |
