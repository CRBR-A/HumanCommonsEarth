| Geography | Indian Ocean |
| --- | --- |
| Location: | body of water between Africa, the Southern Ocean, Asia, and Australia |
| Geographic coordinates: | 20 00 S, 80 00 E |
| Map references: | Political Map of the World |
| Area: | total: 68.556 million sq km |
| Area: | note: includes Andaman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Flores Sea, Great Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Java Sea, Mozambique Channel, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Savu Sea, Strait of Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies |
| Area - comparative: | almost 7 times the size of the US |
| Coastline: | 66,526 km |
| Climate: | northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October); tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November in the northern Indian Ocean and January/February in the southern Indian Ocean |
| Terrain: | surface dominated by a major gyre (broad, circular system of currents) in the southern Indian Ocean and a unique reversal of surface currents in the northern Indian Ocean; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninetyeast Ridge |
| Terrain: | major surface currents: the counterclockwise Indian Ocean Gyre comprised of the warm Agulhas and East Madagascar Currents in the west, the South Indian Current in the south, the cold West Australian Current in the east, and the South Equatorial Current in the north; a distinctive annual reversal of surface currents occurs in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds and clockwise currents, while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling, winter air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds and counterclockwise currents |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: -7,258 m lowest point: Java Trench |
| Elevation: | mean depth: -3,741 m |
| Elevation: | 0 highest point: sea level |
| Natural resources: | oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules |
| Natural hazards: | occasional icebergs pose navigational hazard in southern reaches |
| Environment - current issues: | marine pollution caused by ocean dumping, waste disposal, and oil spills; deep sea mining; oil pollution in Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea; coral reefs threatened due climate change, direct human pressures, and inadequate governance, awareness, and political will; loss of biodiversity; endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales |
| Geography - note: | major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait |
