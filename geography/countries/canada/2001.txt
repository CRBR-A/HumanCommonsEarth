| Geographic coordinates: | 60 00 N, 95 00 W |
| Map references: | North America |
| Area: | total: 9,976,140 sq km |
| Area: | land: 9,220,970 sq km |
| Area: | water: 755,170 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | slightly larger than the US |
| Land boundaries: | total: 8,893 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries: US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska) |
| Coastline: | 243,791 km |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 NM |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 NM or to the edge of the continental margin |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 NM |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 NM |
| Climate: | varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north |
| Terrain: | mostly plains with mountains in west and lowlands in southeast |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: Mount Logan 5,959 m |
| Natural resources: | iron ore, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, potash, silver, fish, timber, wildlife, coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydropower |
| Land use: | arable land: 5% |
| Land use: | permanent crops: 0% |
| Land use: | permanent pastures: 3% |
| Land use: | forests and woodland: 54% |
| Land use: | other: 38% (1993 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 7,100 sq km (1993 est.) |
| Natural hazards: | continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development; cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow |
| Environment - current issues: | air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting lakes and damaging forests; metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting on agricultural and forest productivity; ocean waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulphur 85, Air Pollution-Sulphur 94, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation |
| Geography - note: | second-largest country in world (after Russia); strategic location between Russia and US via north polar route; approximately 85% of the population is concentrated within 300 km of the US/Canada border |
