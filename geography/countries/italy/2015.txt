| Coastline: | 7,600 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation |
| Climate: | predominantly Mediterranean; alpine in far north; hot, dry in south |
| Terrain: | mostly rugged and mountainous; some plains, coastal lowlands |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Mediterranean Sea 0 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) de Courmayeur 4,748 m (a secondary peak of Mont Blanc) |
| Natural resources: | coal, mercury, zinc, potash, marble, barite, asbestos, pumice, fluorspar, feldspar, pyrite (sulfur), natural gas and crude oil reserves, fish, arable land |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 47.1% |
| Land use: | arable land 22.8%; permanent crops 8.6%; permanent pasture 15.7% |

| Natural hazards: | regional risks include landslides, mudflows, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding; land subsidence in Venice |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: significant volcanic activity; Etna (elev. 3,330 m), which is in eruption as of 2010, is Europe's most active volcano; flank eruptions pose a threat to nearby Sicilian villages; Etna, along with the famous Vesuvius, which remains a threat to the millions of nearby residents in the Bay of Naples area, have both been deemed Decade Volcanoes by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to their explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Stromboli, on its namesake island, has also been continuously active with moderate volcanic activity; other historically active volcanoes include Campi Flegrei, Ischia, Larderello, Pantelleria, Vulcano, and Vulsini |

| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | strategic location dominating central Mediterranean as well as southern sea and air approaches to Western Europe |
