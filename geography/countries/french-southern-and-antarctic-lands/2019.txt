| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm from Iles Kerguelen and Iles Eparses (does not include the rest of French Southern and Antarctic Lands); Juan de Nova Island and Tromelin Island claim a continental shelf of 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation |
| Climate: | Ile Amsterdam et Ile Saint-Paul: oceanic with persistent westerly winds and high humidity; |
| Climate: | Iles Crozet: windy, cold, wet, and cloudy; |
| Climate: | Iles Kerguelen: oceanic, cold, overcast, windy; |
| Climate: | Iles Eparses: tropical |
| Terrain: | Ile Amsterdam (Ile Amsterdam et Ile Saint-Paul): a volcanic island with steep coastal cliffs; the center floor of the volcano is a large plateau; |
| Terrain: | Ile Saint-Paul (Ile Amsterdam et Ile Saint-Paul): triangular in shape, the island is the top of a volcano, rocky with steep cliffs on the eastern side; has active thermal springs; |
| Terrain: | Iles Crozet: a large archipelago formed from the Crozet Plateau is divided into two groups of islands; |
| Terrain: | Iles Kerguelen: the interior of the large island of Ile Kerguelen is composed of high mountains, hills, valleys, and plains with peninsulas stretching off its coasts; |
| Terrain: | Bassas da India (Iles Eparses): atoll, awash at high tide; shallow (15 m) lagoon; |
| Terrain: | Europa Island, Glorioso Islands, Juan de Nova Island: low, flat, and sandy; |
| Terrain: | Tromelin Island (Iles Eparses): low, flat, sandy; likely volcanic seamount |
| Elevation: | lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Mont de la Dives on Ile Amsterdam (Ile Amsterdam et Ile Saint-Paul) 867 m |
| Elevation: | highest points throughout the French Southern and Antarctic Lands: unnamed location on Ile Saint-Paul (Ile Amsterdam et Ile Saint-Paul) 272 m; Pic Marion-Dufresne in Iles Crozet 1090 m; Mont Ross in Iles Kerguelen 1850 m; unnamed location on Bassas de India (Iles Eparses) 2.4 m;24 unnamed location on Europa Island (Iles Eparses)Â 24 m; unnamed location on Glorioso Islands (Iles Eparses) 12 m; unnamed location on Juan de Nova Island (Iles Eparses) 10 m; unnamed location on Tromelin Island (Iles Eparses) 7 m |
| Natural resources: | fish, crayfish, note, Glorioso Islands and Tromelin Island (Iles Eparses) have guano, phosphates, and coconuts |
| Natural resources: | note - in the 1950's and 1960's, several species of trout were introduced to Iles Kerguelen of which two, Brown trout and Brook trout, survived to establish wild populations; reindeer were also introduced to Iles Kerguelen in 1956 as a source of fresh meat for whaling crews, the herd today, one of two in the Southern Hemisphere,Â is estimated to number around 4,000 |
| Natural hazards: | Ile Amsterdam and Ile Saint-Paul are inactive volcanoes; Iles Eparses subject to periodic cyclones; Bassas da India is a maritime hazard since it is under water for a period of three hours prior to and following the high tide and surrounded by reefs |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: Reunion Island - Piton de la Fournaise (2,632 m), which has erupted many times in recent years including 2010, 2015, and 2017, is one of the world's most active volcanoes; although rare, eruptions outside the volcano's caldera could threaten nearby cities |
| Environment - current issues: | introduction of foreign species on Iles Crozet has caused severe damage to the original ecosystem; overfishing of Patagonian toothfish around Iles Crozet and Iles Kerguelen |
| Geography - note: | islands' component is widely scattered across remote locations in the southern Indian Ocean |
| Geography - note: | Bassas da India (Iles Eparses): atoll is a circular reef atop a long-extinct, submerged volcano; |
| Geography - note: | Europa Island and Juan de Nova Island (Iles Eparses): wildlife sanctuary for seabirds and sea turtles; |
| Geography - note: | Glorioso Island (Iles Eparses): islands and rocks are surrounded by an extensive reef system; |
| Geography - note: | Tromelin Island (Iles Eparses): climatologically important location for forecasting cyclones in the western Indian Ocean; wildlife sanctuary (seabirds, tortoises) |
