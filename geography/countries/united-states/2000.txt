| Geographic coordinates: | 38 00 N, 97 00 W |
| Map references: | North America |
| Area: | total: 9,629,091 sq km |
| Area: | land: 9,158,960 sq km |
| Area: | water: 470,131 sq km |
| Area: | note: includes only the 50 states and District of Columbia |
| Area - comparative: | about one-half the size of Russia; about three-tenths the size of Africa; about one-half the size of South America (or slightly larger than Brazil); slightly larger than China; about two and one-half times the size of Western Europe |
| Land boundaries: | total: 12,248 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries: Canada 8,893 km (including 2,477 km with Alaska), Cuba 29 km (US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay), Mexico 3,326 km |
| Land boundaries: | note: Guantanamo Naval Base is leased by the US and thus remains part of Cuba |
| Coastline: | 19,924 km |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: not specified |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Climate: | mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida, arctic in Alaska, semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi River, and arid in the Great Basin of the southwest; low winter temperatures in the northwest are ameliorated occasionally in January and February by warm chinook winds from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains |
| Terrain: | vast central plain, mountains in west, hills and low mountains in east; rugged mountains and broad river valleys in Alaska; rugged, volcanic topography in Hawaii |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Death Valley -86 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: Mount McKinley 6,194 m |
| Natural resources: | coal, copper, lead, molybdenum, phosphates, uranium, bauxite, gold, iron, mercury, nickel, potash, silver, tungsten, zinc, petroleum, natural gas, timber |
| Land use: | arable land: 19% |
| Land use: | permanent crops: 0% |
| Land use: | permanent pastures: 25% |
| Land use: | forests and woodland: 30% |
| Land use: | other: 26% (1993 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 207,000 sq km (1993 est.) |
| Natural hazards: | tsunamis, volcanoes, and earthquake activity around Pacific Basin; hurricanes along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts; tornadoes in the midwest and southeast; mud slides in California; forest fires in the west; flooding; permafrost in northern Alaska, a major impediment to development |
| Environment - current issues: | air pollution resulting in acid rain in both the US and Canada; the US is the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels; water pollution from runoff of pesticides and fertilizers; very limited natural fresh water resources in much of the western part of the country require careful management; desertification |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Climate Change, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Biodiversity, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes |
| Geography - note: | world's third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) |
