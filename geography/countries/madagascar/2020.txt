| Natural hazards: | volcanism: Madagascar's volcanoes have not erupted in historical times |
| Environment - current issues: | erosion and soil degredation results from deforestation and overgrazing; desertification; agricultural fires; surface water contaminated with raw sewage and other organic wastes;Â wildlife preservation (endangered species of flora and fauna unique to the island) |

| Geography - note: | world's fourth-largest island; strategic location along Mozambique Channel; despite Madagascarâ€™s close proximity to the African continent, ocean currents isolate the island resulting in high rates of endemic plant and animal species; approximately 90% of the flora and fauna on the island are found nowhere else |
