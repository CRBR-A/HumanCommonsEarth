| Area: | land: 1,279,996 sq km |
| Area: | water: 5,220 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | almost twice the size of Texas; slightly smaller than Alaska |
| Land boundaries: | total: 7,062 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries (5): Bolivia 1,212 km, Brazil 2,659 km, Chile 168 km, Colombia 1,494 km, Ecuador 1,529 km |
| Coastline: | 2,414 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 nm |
| Climate: | varies from tropical in east to dry desert in west; temperate to frigid in Andes |
| Terrain: | western coastal plain (costa), high and rugged Andes in center (sierra), eastern lowland jungle of Amazon Basin (selva) |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 1,555 m |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Nevado Huascaran 6,768 m |
| Natural resources: | copper, silver, gold, petroleum, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, hydropower, natural gas |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 18.8% |
| Land use: | arable land 3.1%; permanent crops 1.1%; permanent pasture 14.6% |
| Land use: | forest: 53% |
| Land use: | other: 28.2% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 25,800 sq km (2012) |
| Population - distribution: | approximately one-third of the population resides along the desert coastal belt in the west, with a strong focus on the capital city of Lima; the Andean highlands, or sierra, which is strongly identified with the country's Amerindian population, contains roughly half of the overall population; the eastern slopes of the Andes, and adjoining rainforest, are sparsely populated |
| Natural hazards: | earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, landslides, mild volcanic activity |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: volcanic activity in the Andes Mountains; Ubinas (elev. 5,672 m), which last erupted in 2009, is the country's most active volcano; other historically active volcanoes include El Misti, Huaynaputina, Sabancaya, and Yucamane |
| Environment - current issues: | deforestation (some the result of illegal logging); overgrazing of the slopes of the costa and sierra leading to soil erosion; desertification; air pollution in Lima; pollution of rivers and coastal waters from municipal and mining wastes |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | shares control of Lago Titicaca, world's highest navigable lake, with Bolivia; a remote slope of Nevado Mismi, a 5,316 m peak, is the ultimate source of the Amazon River |
