| Coastline: | 37,653 km |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 NM |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 NM |
| Climate: | ranges from steppes in the south through humid continental in much of European Russia; subarctic in Siberia to tundra climate in the polar north; winters vary from cool along Black Sea coast to frigid in Siberia; summers vary from warm in the steppes to cool along Arctic coast |
| Terrain: | broad plain with low hills west of Urals; vast coniferous forest and tundra in Siberia; uplands and mountains along southern border regions |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Caspian Sea -28 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: Gora El'brus 5,633 m |
| Natural resources: | wide natural resource base including major deposits of oil, natural gas, coal, and many strategic minerals, timber |
| Natural resources: | note: formidable obstacles of climate, terrain, and distance hinder exploitation of natural resources |
| Land use: | arable land: 7.46% |
| Land use: | permanent crops: 0.11% |
| Land use: | other: 92.43% (1998 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 46,630 sq km (1998 est.) |
| Natural hazards: | permafrost over much of Siberia is a major impediment to development; volcanic activity in the Kuril Islands; volcanoes and earthquakes on the Kamchatka Peninsula; spring floods and summer/autumn forest fires throughout Siberia and parts of European Russia |
| Environment - current issues: | air pollution from heavy industry, emissions of coal-fired electric plants, and transportation in major cities; industrial, municipal, and agricultural pollution of inland waterways and seacoasts; deforestation; soil erosion; soil contamination from improper application of agricultural chemicals; scattered areas of sometimes intense radioactive contamination; groundwater contamination from toxic waste; urban solid waste management; abandoned stocks of obsolete pesticides |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Sulphur 85, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Wetlands, Whaling |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Sulphur 94, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Persistent Organic Pollutants |
| Geography - note: | largest country in the world in terms of area but unfavorably located in relation to major sea lanes of the world; despite its size, much of the country lacks proper soils and climates (either too cold or too dry) for agriculture; Mount Elbrus is Europe's tallest peak |
