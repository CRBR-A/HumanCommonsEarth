| Geography | Svalbard |
| --- | --- |
| Location: | Northern Europe, islands between the Arctic Ocean, Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Norwegian Sea, north of Norway |
| Geographic coordinates: | 78 00 N, 20 00 E |
| Map references: | Arctic Region |
| Area: | total: 62,045 sq km |
| Area: | land: 62,045 sq km |
| Area: | water: 0 sq km |
| Area: | note: includes Spitsbergen and Bjornoya (Bear Island) |
| Area - comparative: | slightly smaller than West Virginia |
| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | 3,587 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: extends to depth of exploitation |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm |
| Climate: | arctic, tempered by warm North Atlantic Current; cool summers, cold winters; North Atlantic Current flows along west and north coasts of Spitsbergen, keeping water open and navigable most of the year |
| Terrain: | rugged mountains; much of the upland areas are ice covered; west coast clear of ice about half the year; fjords along west and north coasts |
| Elevation: | 0 m lowest point: Arctic Ocean |
| Elevation: | 1717 highest point: Newtontoppen |
| Natural resources: | coal, iron ore, copper, zinc, phosphate, wildlife, fish |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 0% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 0% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | forest: 0% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | other: 100% (2011 est.) |
| Population distribution: | the small population is primarily concentrated on the island of Spitsbergen in a handful of settlements on the south side of the Isfjorden, with Longyearbyen being the largest |
| Natural hazards: | ice floes often block the entrance to Bellsund (a transit point for coal export) on the west coast and occasionally make parts of the northeastern coast inaccessible to maritime traffic |
| Environment - current issues: | ice floes are a maritime hazard; past exploitation of mammal species (whale, seal, walrus, and polar bear) severely depleted the populations, but a gradual recovery seems to be occurring |
| Geography - note: | northernmost part of the Kingdom of Norway; consists of nine main islands; glaciers and snowfields cover 60% of the total area; Spitsbergen Island is the site of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a seed repository established by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Norwegian Government |
