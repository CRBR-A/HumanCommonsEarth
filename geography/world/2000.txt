| Area: | total: 510.072 million sq km |
| Area: | land: 148.94 million sq km |
| Area: | water: 361.132 million sq km |
| Area: | note: 70.8% of the world's surface is water, 29.2% is land |
| Area - comparative: | land area about 16 times the size of the US |
| Land boundaries: | the land boundaries in the world total 251,480.24 km (not counting shared boundaries twice) |
| Coastline: | 356,000 km |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm claimed by most, but can vary |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200-m depth claimed by most or to depth of exploitation; others claim 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm claimed by most, but can vary |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm claimed by most, but can vary |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm claimed by most, but can vary |
| Maritime claims: | note: boundary situations with neighboring states prevent many countries from extending their fishing or economic zones to a full 200 nm; 43 nations and other areas that are landlocked include Afghanistan, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Holy See (Vatican City), Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malawi, Mali, Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, Niger, Paraguay, Rwanda, San Marino, Slovakia, Swaziland, Switzerland, Tajikistan, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, West Bank, Zambia, Zimbabwe |
| Climate: | two large areas of polar climates separated by two rather narrow temperate zones from a wide equatorial band of tropical to subtropical climates |
| Terrain: | the greatest ocean depth is the Mariana Trench at 10,924 m in the Pacific Ocean |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Dead Sea -408 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: Mount Everest 8,850 m (1999 est.) |
| Natural resources: | the rapid using up of nonrenewable mineral resources, the depletion of forest areas and wetlands, the extinction of animal and plant species, and the deterioration in air and water quality (especially in Eastern Europe, the former USSR, and China) pose serious long-term problems that governments and peoples are only beginning to address |
| Land use: | arable land: 10% |
| Land use: | permanent crops: 1% |
| Land use: | permanent pastures: 26% |
| Land use: | forests and woodland: 32% |
| Land use: | other: 31% (1993 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 2,481,250 sq km (1993 est.) |
| Natural hazards: | large areas subject to severe weather (tropical cyclones), natural disasters (earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions) |
| Environment - current issues: | large areas subject to overpopulation, industrial disasters, pollution (air, water, acid rain, toxic substances), loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, soil degradation, soil depletion, erosion |
