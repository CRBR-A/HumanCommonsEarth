| Area: | total: 12,173 sq km |
| Area: | land: 12,173 sq km |
| Area: | water: 0 sq km |
| Area: | note: includes the two main islands of East and West Falkland and about 200 small islands |
| Area - comparative: | slightly smaller than Connecticut |

| Coastline: | 1,288 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 nm |

| Climate: | cold marine; strong westerly winds, cloudy, humid; rain occurs on more than half of days in year; average annual rainfall is 60 cm in Stanley; occasional snow all year, except in January and February, but typically does not accumulate |
| Terrain: | rocky, hilly, mountainous with some boggy, undulating plains |
| Elevation: | 0 m lowest point: Atlantic Ocean |
| Elevation: | 705 highest point: Mount Usborne |
| Natural resources: | fish, squid, wildlife, calcified seaweed, sphagnum moss |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 92.4% (2011 est.) |

| Environment - current issues: | overfishing by unlicensed vessels is a problem; reindeer - introduced to the islands in 2001 from South Georgia - are part of a farming effort to produce specialty meat and diversify the islands' economy; this is the only commercial reindeer herd in the world unaffected by the 1986 Chornobyl disaster; grazing threatens important habitats including tussac grass and its ecosystem with penguins and sea lions; soil erosion from fires |
| Geography - note: | deeply indented coast provides good natural harbors; short growing season |
