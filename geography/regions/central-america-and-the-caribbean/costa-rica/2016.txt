| Coastline: | 1,290 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 nm |
| Climate: | tropical and subtropical; dry season (December to April); rainy season (May to November); cooler in highlands |
| Terrain: | coastal plains separated by rugged mountains including over 100 volcanic cones, of which several are major active volcanoes |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 746 m |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Cerro Chirripo 3,810 m |
| Natural resources: | hydropower |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 37.1% |
| Land use: | arable land 4.9%; permanent crops 6.7%; permanent pasture 25.5% |

| Population - distribution: | roughly half of the nation's population resides in urban areas; the capital of San Jose is the largest city and home to approximately one-fifth of the population |
| Natural hazards: | occasional earthquakes, hurricanes along Atlantic coast; frequent flooding of lowlands at onset of rainy season and landslides; active volcanoes |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: Arenal (elev. 1,670 m), which erupted in 2010, is the most active volcano in Costa Rica; a 1968 eruption destroyed the town of Tabacon; Irazu (elev. 3,432 m), situated just east of San Jose, has the potential to spew ash over the capital city as it did between 1963 and 1965; other historically active volcanoes include Miravalles, Poas, Rincon de la Vieja, and Turrialba |
| Environment - current issues: | deforestation and land use change, largely a result of the clearing of land for cattle ranching and agriculture; soil erosion; coastal marine pollution; fisheries protection; solid waste management; air pollution |

| Geography - note: | four volcanoes, two of them active, rise near the capital of San Jose in the center of the country; one of the volcanoes, Irazu, erupted destructively in 1963-65 |
