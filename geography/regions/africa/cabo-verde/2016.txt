| Geography | CABO VERDE |
| --- | --- |
| Location: | Western Africa, group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Senegal |
| Geographic coordinates: | 16 00 N, 24 00 W |
| Map references: | Africa |
| Area: | total: 4,033 sq km |
| Area: | land: 4,033 sq km |
| Area: | water: 0 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | slightly larger than Rhode Island |
| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | 965 km |
| Maritime claims: | measured from claimed archipelagic baselines |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Climate: | temperate; warm, dry summer; precipitation meager and erratic |
| Terrain: | steep, rugged, rocky, volcanic |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: NA |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Mt. Fogo 2,829 m (a volcano on Fogo Island) |
| Natural resources: | salt, basalt rock, limestone, kaolin, fish, clay, gypsum |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 18.6% |
| Land use: | arable land 11.7%; permanent crops 0.7%; permanent pasture 6.2% |
| Land use: | forest: 21% |
| Land use: | other: 60.4% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 35 sq km (2012) |
| Population - distribution: | Among the nine inhabited islands, population distribution is variable. Islands in the east are very dry and are only sparsely settled to exploit their extensive salt deposits. The more southerly islands receive more precipitation and support larger populations, but agriculture and livestock grazing have damaged the soil fertility and vegetation. |
| Natural hazards: | prolonged droughts; seasonal harmattan wind produces obscuring dust; volcanically and seismically active |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: Fogo (elev. 2,829 m), which last erupted in 1995, is Cabo Verde's only active volcano |
| Environment - current issues: | soil erosion; deforestation due to demand for firewood; water shortages; desertification; environmental damage has threatened several species of birds and reptiles; illegal beach sand extraction; overfishing |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | strategic location 500 km from west coast of Africa near major north-south sea routes; important communications station; important sea and air refueling site |
