| Area: | land: 4,033 sq km |
| Area: | water: 0 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | slightly larger than Rhode Island |
| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | 965 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | measured from claimed archipelagic baselines |
| Climate: | temperate; warm, dry summer; precipitation meager and erratic |
| Terrain: | steep, rugged, rocky, volcanic |
| Elevation: | 0 m lowest point: Atlantic Ocean |
| Elevation: | 2829 highest point: Mt. Fogo (a volcano on Fogo Island) |
| Natural resources: | salt, basalt rock, limestone, kaolin, fish, clay, gypsum |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 18.6% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 11.7% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 0.7% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 6.2% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | forest: 21% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | other: 60.4% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 35 sq km (2012) |
| Population distribution: | among the nine inhabited islands, population distribution is variable; islands in the east are very dry and are only sparsely settled to exploit their extensive salt deposits; the more southerly islands receive more precipitation and support larger populations, but agriculture and livestock grazing have damaged the soil fertility and vegetation; approximately half of the population lives on Sao Tiago Island, which is the location of the capital of Praia; Mindelo, on the northern island of Sao Vicente, also has a large urban population |
| Natural hazards: | prolonged droughts; seasonal harmattan wind produces obscuring dust; volcanically and seismically active |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: Fogo (2,829 m), which last erupted in 1995, is Cabo Verde's only active volcano |
| Environment - current issues: | deforestation due to demand for firewood; water shortages; prolonged droughts and improper use of land (overgrazing, crop cultivation on hillsides lead to desertification and erosion); environmental damage has threatened several species of birds and reptiles; illegal beach sand extraction; overfishing |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | strategic location 500 km from west coast of Africa near major north-south sea routes; important communications station; important sea and air refueling site |
