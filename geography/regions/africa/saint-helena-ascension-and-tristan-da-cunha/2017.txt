| Area: | water: 0 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | slightly more than twice the size of Washington, DC |
| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | Saint Helena: 60 km |
| Coastline: | Ascension Island: NA |
| Coastline: | Tristan da Cunha (island only): 34 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm |
| Climate: | Saint Helena: tropical marine; mild, tempered by trade winds |
| Climate: | Ascension Island: tropical marine; mild, semi-arid |
| Climate: | Tristan da Cunha: temperate marine; mild, tempered by trade winds (tends to be cooler than Saint Helena) |
| Terrain: | the islands of this group are of volcanic origin associated with the Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge |
| Terrain: | Saint Helena: rugged, volcanic; small scattered plateaus and plains |
| Terrain: | Ascension: surface covered by lava flows and cinder cones of 44 dormant volcanoes; terrain rises to the east |
| Terrain: | Tristan da Cunha: sheer cliffs line the coastline of the nearly circular island; the flanks of the central volcanic peak are deeply dissected; narrow coastal plain lies between The Peak and the coastal cliffs |

| Population - distribution: | Saint Helena - population is concentrated in and around the capital Jamestown in the northwest, with another significant cluster in the interior Longwood area; Ascension - largest settlement, and location of most of the population, is Georgetown; Tristan da Cunha - most of the nearly 300 inhabitants live in the northern coastal town of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas |
| Natural hazards: | active volcanism on Tristan da Cunha |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: the island volcanoes of Tristan da Cunha (2,060 m) and Nightingale Island (365 m) experience volcanic activity; Tristan da Cunha erupted in 1962 and Nightingale in 2004 |
| Environment - current issues: | development threatens unique biota on Saint Helena |
| Geography - note: | Saint Helena harbors at least 40 species of plants unknown elsewhere in the world; Ascension is a breeding ground for sea turtles and sooty terns; Queen Mary's Peak on Tristan da Cunha is the highest island mountain in the South Atlantic and a prominent landmark on the sea lanes around southern Africa |
