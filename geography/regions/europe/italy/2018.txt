| Land boundaries: | total: 1,836.4 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries (6): Austria 404 km, France 476 km, Holy See (Vatican City) 3.4 km, San Marino 37 km, Slovenia 218 km, Switzerland 698 km |
| Coastline: | 7,600 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation |
| Climate: | predominantly Mediterranean; alpine in far north; hot, dry in south |
| Terrain: | mostly rugged and mountainous; some plains, coastal lowlands |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 538 m |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: 0 m lowest point: Mediterranean Sea |
| Elevation: | 4748 highest point: Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) de Courmayeur (a secondary peak of Mont Blanc) |
| Natural resources: | coal, antimony, mercury, zinc, potash, marble, barite, asbestos, pumice, fluorspar, feldspar, pyrite (sulfur), natural gas and crude oil reserves, fish, arable land |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 47.1% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 22.8% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 8.6% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 15.7% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | forest: 31.4% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | other: 21.5% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 39,500 sq km (2012) |
| Population distribution: | despite a distinctive pattern with an industrial north and an agrarian south, a fairly even population distribution exists throughout most of the country, with coastal areas, the Po River Valley, and urban centers (particularly Milan, Rome, and Naples), attracting larger and denser populations |
| Natural hazards: | regional risks include landslides, mudflows, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding; land subsidence in Venice |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: significant volcanic activity; Etna (3,330 m), which is in eruption as of 2010, is Europe's most active volcano; flank eruptions pose a threat to nearby Sicilian villages; Etna, along with the famous Vesuvius, which remains a threat to the millions of nearby residents in the Bay of Naples area, have both been deemed Decade Volcanoes by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to their explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Stromboli, on its namesake island, has also been continuously active with moderate volcanic activity; other historically active volcanoes include Campi Flegrei, Ischia, Larderello, Pantelleria, Vulcano, and Vulsini |
| Environment - current issues: | air pollution from industrial emissions such as sulfur dioxide; coastal and inland rivers polluted from industrial and agricultural effluents; acid rain damaging lakes; inadequate industrial waste treatment and disposal facilities |

| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | strategic location dominating central Mediterranean as well as southern sea and air approaches to Western Europe |
