| Area: | total: 462,840 sq km |
| Area: | land: 452,860 sq km |
| Area: | water: 9,980 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | slightly larger than California |
| Land boundaries: | total: 824 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries (1): Indonesia 824 km |
| Coastline: | 5,152 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | measured from claimed archipelagic baselines |
| Climate: | tropical; northwest monsoon (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October); slight seasonal temperature variation |
| Terrain: | mostly mountains with coastal lowlands and rolling foothills |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 667 m |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: 0 m lowest point: Pacific Ocean |
| Elevation: | 4509 highest point: Mount Wilhelm |
| Natural resources: | gold, copper, silver, natural gas, timber, oil, fisheries |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 2.6% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 0.7% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 1.5% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 0.4% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | forest: 63.1% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | other: 34.3% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 0 sq km (2012) |
| Population distribution: | population concentrated in the highlands and eastern coastal areas on the island of New Guinea; predominantly a rural distribution with only about one-fifth of the population residing in urban areas |
| Natural hazards: | active volcanism; the country is subject to frequent and sometimes severe earthquakes; mud slides; tsunamis |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: severe volcanic activity; Ulawun (2,334 m), one of Papua New Guinea's potentially most dangerous volcanoes, has been deemed a Decade Volcano by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Rabaul (688 m) destroyed the city of Rabaul in 1937 and 1994; Lamington erupted in 1951 killing 3,000 people; Manam's 2004 eruption forced the island's abandonment; other historically active volcanoes include Bam, Bagana, Garbuna, Karkar, Langila, Lolobau, Long Island, Pago, St. Andrew Strait, Victory, and Waiowa; see note 2 under "Geography - note" |
| Environment - current issues: | rain forest loss as a result of growing commercial demand for tropical timber; unsustainable logging practices result in soil erosion, water quality degredation, and loss of habitat and biodiversity; large-scale mining projects cause adverse impacts on forests and water quality (discharge of heavy metals, cyanide, and acids into rivers); severe drought; inappropriate farming practices accelerate land degradion (soil erosion, siltation, loss of soil fertility); destructive fishing practices and coastal pollution due to run-off from land-based activities and oil spills |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | note 1: shares island of New Guinea with Indonesia; generally east-west trending highlands break up New Guinea into diverse ecoregions; one of world's largest swamps along southwest coast |
| Geography - note: | note 2: Papua New Guinea is one of the countries along the Ring of Fire, a belt of active volcanoes and earthquake epicenters bordering the Pacific Ocean; up to 90% of the world's earthquakes and some 75% of the world's volcanoes occur within the Ring of Fire |
