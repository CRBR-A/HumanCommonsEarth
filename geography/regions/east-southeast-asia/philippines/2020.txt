| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | 36,289 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: irregular polygon extending up to 100 nm from coastline as defined by 1898 treaty; since late 1970s has also claimed polygonal-shaped area in South China Sea as wide as 285 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: to the depth of exploitation |
| Climate: | tropical marine; northeast monsoon (November to April); southwest monsoon (May to October) |
| Terrain: | mostly mountains with narrow to extensive coastal lowlands |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 442 m |
| Elevation: | lowest point: Philippine Sea 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Mount Apo 2,954 m |
| Natural resources: | timber, petroleum, nickel, cobalt, silver, gold, salt, copper |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 41% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 18.2% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 17.8% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 5% (2011 est.) |

| Land use: | other: 33.1% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 16,270 sq km (2012) |
| Population distribution: | population concentrated where good farmlands lie; highest concentrations are northwest and south-central Luzon, the southeastern extension of Luzon, and the islands of the Visayan Sea, particularly Cebu and Negros; Manila is home to one-eighth of the entire national population |
| Natural hazards: | astride typhoon belt, usually affected by 15 and struck by five to six cyclonic storms each year; landslides; active volcanoes; destructive earthquakes; tsunamis |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: significant volcanic activity; Taal (311 m), which has shown recent unrest and may erupt in the near future, has been deemed a Decade Volcano by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Mayon (2,462 m), the country's most active volcano, erupted in 2009 forcing over 33,000 to be evacuated; other historically active volcanoes include Biliran, Babuyan Claro, Bulusan, Camiguin, Camiguin de Babuyanes, Didicas, Iraya, Jolo, Kanlaon, Makaturing, Musuan, Parker, Pinatubo, and Ragang; see note 2 under "Geography - note" |
| Environment - current issues: | uncontrolled deforestation especially in watershed areas; illegal mining and logging; soil erosion; air and water pollution in major urban centers; coral reef degradation; increasing pollution of coastal mangrove swamps that are important fish breeding grounds; coastal erosion; dynamite fishing; wildlife extinction |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants |
| Geography - note: | note 1: for decades, the Philippine archipelago was reported as having 7,107 islands; in 2016, the national mapping authority reported that hundreds of new islands had been discovered and increased the number of islands to 7,641 - though not all of the new islands have been verified; the country is favorably located in relation to many of Southeast Asia's main water bodies: the South China Sea, Philippine Sea, Sulu Sea, Celebes Sea, and Luzon Strait |
| Geography - note: | note 2: Philippines is one of the countries along the Ring of Fire, a belt of active volcanoes and earthquake epicenters bordering the Pacific Ocean; up to 90% of the world's earthquakes and some 75% of the world's volcanoes occur within the Ring of Fire |
| Geography - note: | note 3: the Philippines sits astride the Pacific typhoon belt and an average of 9 typhoons make landfall on the islands each year - with about 5 of these being destructive; the country is the most exposed in the world to tropical storms |
