| Natural hazards: | cyclones along the coast; severe droughts; forest fires |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: volcanic activity on Heard and McDonald Islands |
| Environment - current issues: | soil erosion from overgrazing, industrial development, urbanization, and poor farming practices; soil salinity rising due to the use of poor quality water; desertification; clearing for agricultural purposes threatens the natural habitat of many unique animal and plant species; the Great Barrier Reef off the northeast coast, the largest coral reef in the world, is threatened by increased shipping and its popularity as a tourist site; limited natural freshwater resources |
