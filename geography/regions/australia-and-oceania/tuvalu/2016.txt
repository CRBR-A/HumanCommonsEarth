| Area: | water: 0 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | 0.1 times the size of Washington, DC |

| Coastline: | 24 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Climate: | tropical; moderated by easterly trade winds (March to November); westerly gales and heavy rain (November to March) |
| Terrain: | low-lying and narrow coral atolls |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: NA |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: unnamed location 5 m |
| Natural resources: | fish, coconut (copra) |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 60% |
| Land use: | arable land 0%; permanent crops 60%; permanent pasture 0% |
| Land use: | forest: 33.3% |
| Land use: | other: 6.7% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 0 sq km (2012) |
| Natural hazards: | severe tropical storms are usually rare, but in 1997 there were three cyclones; low levels of islands make them sensitive to changes in sea level |
| Environment - current issues: | since there are no streams or rivers and groundwater is not potable, most water needs must be met by catchment systems with storage facilities; beachhead erosion because of the use of sand for building materials; excessive clearance of forest undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from increasing ocean temperatures and acidification; Tuvalu is concerned about global increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on rising sea levels, which threaten the country's underground water table; in 2000, the government appealed to Australia and New Zealand to take in Tuvaluans if rising sea levels should make evacuation necessary |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements |
| Geography - note: | one of the smallest and most remote countries on Earth; six of the nine coral atolls - Nanumea, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, and Nukulaelae - have lagoons open to the ocean; Nanumaya and Niutao have landlocked lagoons; Niulakita does not have a lagoon |
