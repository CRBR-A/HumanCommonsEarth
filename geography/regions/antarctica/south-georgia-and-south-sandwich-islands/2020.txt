| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm |
| Climate: | variable, with mostly westerly winds throughout the year interspersed with periods of calm; nearly all precipitation falls as snow |
| Terrain: | most of the islands are rugged and mountainous rising steeply from the sea; South Georgia is largely barren with steep, glacier-covered mountains; the South Sandwich Islands are of volcanic origin with some active volcanoes |

| Elevation: | highest point: Mount Paget (South Georgia) 2,934 m |

| Land use: | agricultural land: 0% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 0% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | forest: 0% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | other: 100% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 0 sq km (2011) |
| Natural hazards: | the South Sandwich Islands have prevailing weather conditions that generally make them difficult to approach by ship; they are also subject to active volcanism |
| Environment - current issues: | reindeer - introduced to the islands in the 20th century - devastated the native flora and bird species; some reindeer were translocated to the Falkland Islands in 2001, the rest were exterminated (2013-14); a parallel effort (2010-15) eradicated rats and mice that came to the islands as stowaways on ships as early as the late 18th century |
| Geography - note: | the north coast of South Georgia has several large bays, which provide good anchorage |
