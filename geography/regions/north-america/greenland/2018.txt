| Location: | Northern North America, island between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Canada |
| Geographic coordinates: | 72 00 N, 40 00 W |
| Map references: | Arctic Region |
| Area: | total: 2,166,086 sq km |
| Area: | land: 2,166,086 sq km (approximately 1,710,000 sq km ice-covered) |
| Area - comparative: | slightly more than three times the size of Texas |
| Land boundaries: | 0 km |
| Coastline: | 44,087 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 3 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line |
| Climate: | arctic to subarctic; cool summers, cold winters |
| Terrain: | flat to gradually sloping icecap covers all but a narrow, mountainous, barren, rocky coast |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 1,792 m |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: 0 m lowest point: Atlantic Ocean |
| Elevation: | 3694 highest point: Gunnbjorn Fjeld |
| Natural resources: | coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds, gold, platinum, niobium, tantalite, uranium, fish, seals, whales, hydropower, possible oil and gas |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 0.6% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 0.6% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | forest: 0% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | other: 99.4% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | NA |
| Population distribution: | settlement concentrated on the southwest shoreline, with limited settlements scattered along the remaining coast; interior is uninhabited |
| Natural hazards: | continuous permafrost over northern two-thirds of the island |
| Environment - current issues: | especially vulnerable to climate change and disruption of the Arctic environment; preservation of the Inuit traditional way of life, including whaling and seal hunting |
| Geography - note: | dominates North Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe; sparse population confined to small settlements along coast; close to one-quarter of the population lives in the capital, Nuuk; world's second largest ice sheet after that of Antarctica covering an area of 1.71 million sq km (660,000 sq mi) or about 79% of the island, and containing 2.85 million cu km (684 thousand cu mi) of ice (this is almost 7% of all of the world's fresh water); if all this ice were converted to liquid water, one estimate is that it would be sufficient to raise the height of the world's oceans by 7.2 m (24 ft) |
