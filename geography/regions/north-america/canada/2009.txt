| Area: | total: 9,984,670 sq km |
| Area: | land: 9,093,507 sq km |
| Area: | water: 891,163 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | somewhat larger than the US |
| Land boundaries: | total: 8,893 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries: US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska) |
| Coastline: | 202,080 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin |
| Climate: | varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north |
| Terrain: | mostly plains with mountains in west and lowlands in southeast |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: Mount Logan 5,959 m |
| Natural resources: | iron ore, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, potash, diamonds, silver, fish, timber, wildlife, coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydropower |
| Land use: | arable land: 4.57% |
| Land use: | permanent crops: 0.65% |
| Land use: | other: 94.78% (2005) |
| Irrigated land: | 7,850 sq km (2003) |
| Total renewable water resources: | 3,300 cu km (1985) |

| Natural hazards: | continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development; cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east of the mountains |
| Environment - current issues: | air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting lakes and damaging forests; metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting on agricultural and forest productivity; ocean waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities |
