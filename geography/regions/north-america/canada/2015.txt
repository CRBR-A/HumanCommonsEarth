| Area: | water: 891,163 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | slightly larger than the US |
| Land boundaries: | total: 8,893 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries (1): US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska) |
| Land boundaries: | note: Canada is the world's largest country that borders only one country |
| Coastline: | 202,080 km |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin |
| Climate: | varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north |
| Terrain: | mostly plains with mountains in west, lowlands in southeast |
| Elevation extremes: | lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation extremes: | highest point: Mount Logan 5,959 m |
| Natural resources: | iron ore, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, rare earth elements, molybdenum, potash, diamonds, silver, fish, timber, wildlife, coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydropower |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 6.8% |
| Land use: | arable land 4.7%; permanent crops 0.5%; permanent pasture 1.6% |
| Land use: | forest: 34.1% |
| Land use: | other: 59.1% (2011 est.) |
| Irrigated land: | 8,699 sq km (2004) |
| Total renewable water resources: | 2,902 cu km (2011) |

| Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural): | per capita: 1,589  cu m/yr (2010) |
| Natural hazards: | continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development; cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east of the mountains |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: the vast majority of volcanoes in Western Canada's Coast Mountains remain dormant |
| Environment - current issues: | metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting on agricultural and forest productivity; air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting lakes and damaging forests; ocean waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities |

| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Marine Life Conservation |
| Geography - note: | second-largest country in world (after Russia) and largest in the Americas; strategic location between Russia and US via north polar route; approximately 90% of the population is concentrated within 160 km (100 mi) of the US border; Canada has more fresh water than any other country and almost 9% of Canadian territory is water; Canada has at least 2 million and possibly over 3 million lakes - that is more than all other countries combined |
