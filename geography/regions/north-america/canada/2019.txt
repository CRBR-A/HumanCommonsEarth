| Area - comparative: | slightly larger than the US |
| Land boundaries: | total: 8,893 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries (1): US 8893 km (includes 2477 km with Alaska) |
| Land boundaries: | note: Canada is the world's largest country that borders only one country |
| Coastline: | 202,080 km |
| Coastline: | note: the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - consisting of 36,563 islands, several of them some of the world's largest - contributes to Canada easily having the longest coastline in the world |
| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |
| Maritime claims: | exclusive economic zone: 200 nm |
| Maritime claims: | contiguous zone: 24 nm |
| Maritime claims: | continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin |
| Climate: | varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north |
| Terrain: | mostly plains with mountains in west, lowlands in southeast |
| Elevation: | mean elevation: 487 m |
| Elevation: | lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Mount Logan 5,959 m |
| Natural resources: | bauxite, iron ore, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, rare earth elements, molybdenum, potash, diamonds, silver, fish, timber, wildlife, coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydropower |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 6.8% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | arable land: 4.7% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 0.5% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 1.6% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | forest: 34.1% (2011 est.) |
| Land use: | other: 59.1% (2011 est.) |

| Population distribution: | vast majority of Canadians are positioned in a discontinuous band within approximately 300 km of the southern border with the United States; the most populated province is Ontario, followed by Quebec and British Columbia |
| Natural hazards: | continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development; cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east of the mountains |
| Natural hazards: | volcanism: the vast majority of volcanoes in Western Canada's Coast Mountains remain dormant |
| Environment - current issues: | metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting agricultural and forest productivity; air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting lakes and damaging forests; ocean waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities |
| Environment - international agreements: | party to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands |
| Environment - international agreements: | signed, but not ratified: Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Marine Life Conservation |
| Geography - note: | note 1: second-largest country in world (after Russia) and largest in the Americas; strategic location between Russia and US via north polar route; approximately 90% of the population is concentrated within 160 km (100 mi) of the US border |
| Geography - note: | note 2: Canada has more fresh water than any other country and almost 9% of Canadian territory is water; Canada has at least 2 million and possibly over 3 million lakes - that is more than all other countries combined |
