| Area: | water: 22,000 sq km |
| Area - comparative: | about four times the size of Virginia; slightly larger than California |
| Land boundaries: | total: 6,893 km |
| Land boundaries: | border countries (5): Afghanistan 144 km, Kazakhstan 2,330 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,314 km, Tajikistan 1,312 km, Turkmenistan 1,793 km |
| Coastline: | 0 km (doubly landlocked); note - Uzbekistan includes the southern portion of the Aral Sea with a 420 km shoreline |

| Elevation: | mean elevation: NA |
| Elevation: | elevation extremes: lowest point: Sariqamish Kuli -12 m |
| Elevation: | highest point: Adelunga Toghi 4,301 m |

| Natural hazards: | NA |
| Environment - current issues: | shrinkage of the Aral Sea has resulted in growing concentrations of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then blown from the increasingly exposed lake bed and contribute to desertification and respiratory health problems; water pollution from industrial wastes and the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides is the cause of many human health disorders; increasing soil salination; soil contamination from buried nuclear processing and agricultural chemicals, including DDT |
